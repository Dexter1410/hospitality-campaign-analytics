# Hospitality Campaign Analytics: Evaluating the "Target Campaign"

## Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of a "Target Campaign" launched in January 2025 by a leading hospitality enterprise. The primary objective was to evaluate the campaign's performance by measuring its impact on enterprise revenue, customer acquisition, and its interaction with other ongoing marketing efforts (including Member Rates, Evergreen, and Time-Bound offers). The analysis culminates in data-driven recommendations designed to optimize future marketing strategies and drive sustainable growth.

## Key Objectives

*   **Evaluate Revenue Impact**: Quantify the revenue growth directly attributable to the Target Campaign.
*   **Analyze Cannibalization Effects**: Determine if the Target Campaign negatively impacted other marketing campaigns by drawing away their customer base.
*   **Assess Customer Acquisition**: Analyze the campaign's effectiveness in attracting new customers versus retaining existing ones.
*   **Identify Key Drivers**: Pinpoint the top-performing channels and hotel brands that generated the most revenue and engagement.
*   **Deliver Strategic Recommendations**: Formulate actionable insights to enhance future campaign performance and improve data governance.

## Key Findings

The analysis of campaign data from January 1, 2025, to February 1, 2025, yielded several critical insights:

*   **Exceptional Revenue Growth**: The Target Campaign was a resounding success, driving a **75.3% increase** in enterprise revenue from ₹380.66 Cr to ₹667.64 Cr post-launch[1].
*   **Superior Campaign Model**: The campaign outperformed previous time-bound campaigns by a staggering **241%** in revenue, demonstrating a highly effective model for customer engagement[1].
*   **Powerful Customer Acquisition Engine**: The campaign proved highly effective at expanding the customer base, with **82%** of its participants being new to the enterprise[1].
*   **Evidence of Cannibalization**: The campaign's success led to a notable decline in new customer acquisition for the "Member Rates" campaign, indicating that loyalty members were opting for the Target Campaign's more attractive offers[1].
*   **Concentrated Performance Drivers**:
    *   **Channel CHA-1** was the dominant channel, contributing approximately 51% of the total post-launch revenue[1].
    *   **Brands B-1, B-2, and B-3** were the primary engines of growth, collectively accounting for around 87% of post-launch revenue[1].
*   **Critical Data Discrepancy**: A **₹4 Cr revenue gap** was identified in the data for CHA-1, highlighting an urgent need for a robust data reconciliation framework[1].

## Strategic Recommendations

Based on the findings, the following strategic recommendations were formulated to drive future growth:

1.  **Focus on High-Performing Assets**: Reallocate marketing resources to the top-performing channels (CHA-1, CHA-3, CHA-4) and brands (B-1, B-2, B-3) to maximize return on investment[1].
2.  **Mitigate Cannibalization**: Refine campaign offers to create clear differentiation from Member Rates. A/B test personalized follow-up strategies to retain loyalty members while still attracting new customers[1].
3.  **Strengthen Customer Retention**: While the campaign excelled at acquisition, implement targeted strategies to improve long-term retention and repeat engagement from the newly acquired customer cohort[1].
4.  **Improve Data Governance**: Establish a standardized data management framework to correct existing data discrepancies and ensure accurate, consistent tracking across all campaigns and platforms[1].
